URINE COLLECTION PROCEDURES
During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to
occur before practices on non-game days, and before shoot-arounds and
games on game days. For random drug testing of a visiting team scheduled
at game-day shoot-arounds, tests will be scheduled to occur before the
shoot-around for that team commences, and for any tests that are not
completed by the time the visiting team bus is scheduled to leave the arena
or practice facility after the shoot-around is completed, the team will
provide alternate transportation to the team hotel for any player that must
remain at the arena or practice facility to complete the testing process and
will ensure that a Team staff member remains with the affected player(s)
and accompanies him or them back to the Team's hotel. Random drug
tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-Season.
When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure
that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or
identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.
The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The
player will then provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of
the collector.
The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen
of sufficient volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot
immediately be provided by the player, he shall be instructed to remain at
the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can provide such a
specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a
sealed specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the
presence of the player, will pour the specimen into two bottles. One bottle
will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and the other will be used as
the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with
tamper-proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a
unique identification number that corresponds to the number on the chain
of custody form.The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form
(which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the
handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities
concerning the specimen on the chain of custody form. Both the player
and collector will sign the chain of custody form. The kit will be sealed
and sent via an overnight delivery service to the laboratory for testing. If a
hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be included in the kit
containing the two specimens that is sent by overnight delivery service to
the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is used, it will be
sent to the laboratory electronically.
Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be
placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different
laboratory, if requested by the player.EXHIBIT I-4
BLOOD COLLECTION PROCEDURES
During the Season, collections for random testing will be scheduled to
occur after practices on non-game days, and after games on game day.
Random tests can be scheduled to occur at any time during the Off-
Season.
When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure
that the player is positively identified through presentation of photo ID or
identification by a team representative. If the player's identity cannot be
established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection. After
check-in, the player will be advised to take a 15-minute hydration period if
immediately coming off the court.
The player will be asked to select two blood collection kits (one as a
back-up) and another kit which will be used to transport the specimen.
Collections will be performed by blood collection specialists (who are
phlebotomists, registered and licensed nurses, medical assistants or
paramedics).
The blood collection specialist shall collect a total of 10 ml of blood
(approximately 1 tablespoon). The player's non-dominant arm will be used
to make the initial blood draw attempt. If the blood draw is not possible
or successful from the non-dominant arm, the dominant arm may be used.
No more than three (3) attempts will be made to draw a blood specimen.
After that, the collection will be discontinued. Upon completing the blood
draw, the blood collection specialist will ensure that the draw site is not
bleeding and bandage the site.
The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form
(which may be in hard copy or electronic form) that documents the
handling of the specimens. Both the player and collector will sign the
chain of custody form. The two specimens will be sealed in a blood
specimen bag, and sent via an overnight delivery service to the laboratory
for testing. If a hard copy chain-of-custody form is used, it will be
included in the kit containing the two specimens that is sent by overnightdelivery service to the laboratory. If an electronic chain-of-custody form is
used, it will be sent to the laboratory electronically.
Once the specimens arrive at the laboratory, the primary specimen will
be analyzed. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be
placed in frozen storage and will be available for testing by a different
laboratory, if requested by the player.EXHIBIT I-5

CREATION OF PLAYER LONGITUDINAL PROFILES
The following protocol will be used to create the Longitudinal Profiles
described in Article XXXIII, Section 18 above:
Step 1: Beginning with the 2017-18 Season, the Program's
drug collection company will assign each player a unique
personal identification number. A player's personal
identification number will remain the same for all periods
of time he is covered by the Program, and will only be used
for the purposes of the Longitudinal Profile. Other than to
the designated representatives or employees within the
drug collection company and the Laboratory, the drug
collection company will not disclose the personal
identification number that corresponds to the player's
name to any individual other than one representative each
of the NBA and the Players Association.
Step 2: The Laboratory (as defined in Article XXXIII,
Section 18(a)) will maintain a secure, separate database for
each player's personal identification number that contains
his corresponding Testosterone concentration,
epitestosterone concentration and Testosterone/
Epitestosterone ("T/E") ratio (referred to collectively as
the "Baseline Values"). This database will not contain any
identifying information for the players.
Step 3: The Baseline Values will be calculated, pursuant to
the Laboratory's operating standards, by averaging a
player's T/E ratio, Testosterone concentration and
Epitestosterone concentration, respectively, from three
negative tests conducted under the Program. After a
player's Baseline Values are established, those values will be
considered a player's Longitudinal Profile for the duration
of his coverage under the Program. New Baseline Valueswill be calculated for a player upon the recommendation of
the director of the Laboratory.
Step 4: The Laboratory will compare the Baseline Values
to the corresponding Specimen Values (as defined in
Article XXXIII, Section 18(c)) in subsequent tests
identified with a player's personal identification number in
determining whether it will conduct IRMS analysis (as
defined in Section 18(a) above) on a urine specimen.
